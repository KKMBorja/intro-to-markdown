<!--Strong-->

This is an example of **strong text**, anything between two opening asterisks and two closing asterisks will be displayed as **strong text**

This is another example of a way to have __strong text__ in our document. Anything between two opening underscores and closing underscores will be displayed as __strong text__.

<!--Strike Through-->

This is an example of a ~~strikethrough~~ text. Anything between the opening double tilde and closing double tilde characters will be displayed as ~~strikethrough~~ text.

<!--Horizontal Rule-->

We can add triple hyphens to create a horizontal rule for separating content. 

Another way to add _Horizontal Rules_ in our document markdown is by using three underscores.
